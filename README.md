# Attaining-Extended-Discharge-Periods-in-Capacitors-Using-Additional-Tau-Periods
Capacitors are typically charged only until the point at which their power reaches 5 Tau, or 99.3262053% of the source voltage.
Capacitors hold and release charge in periods of Tau. As a capacitor will never reach 100% of charge, any period beyond 99.33% charge is within safe operating conditions. Charging with additional Tau cycles which near 100% but never exceed the 1/1 threshold creates a field which has extended Tau cycles of power. 

Example: If a device is charged for 10 Tau on a circuit, the circuit will have power from the capacitor for 5*RC longer than when charged for 5 Tau.
